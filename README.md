# Instructions

This is a PHP solution for the coding challenged titled "Revenge of the Pancakes." It was written my Marc D. Young.

You can run this two ways, either in the command line or in Docker. The instructions for both follows.

## Command line

To run in the command line, complete the following:

1. Open terminal in Mac or Linux. In Windows, it might require some the use of GitBash or some other tool.
2. `git clone git@github.com:mdyoung3/pancake.git pancake`
3. `cd pancake`
4. `php index.php`

## Alternative options

If you cannot run php-cli, then you have the option of using docker. To run in docker, complete the follow:

1. Open terminal in Mac or Linux. In Windows, it might require some the use of GitBash or some other tool.
2. `git clone git@github.com:mdyoung3/pancake.git pancake`
3. `cd pancake`
